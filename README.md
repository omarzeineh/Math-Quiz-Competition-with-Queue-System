# Math Quiz Competition with Queue System

This project implements a **competitive math quiz system** with real-time queue management. Clients must join a virtual queue before participating in a timed math challenge. The system ensures fairness, secure login, and smooth handling of multiple players.

## ðŸ“Œ Features
- **Queue Management:** Players are placed in a waiting queue before the game starts.  
- **Game Start Conditions:** 
  - Starts when at least **5 players** join.  
  - If fewer players, game starts after **60 seconds** with a minimum of **2 players**.  
- **Secure Authentication:** Player credentials are validated against `Players.txt`.  
- **Multithreading Support:** 
  - `PlayerInfoThread` handles login and authentication.  
  - `QueueThread` manages the player queue.  
  - `GameThread` runs the quiz game logic.  
- **Resilience:** If a player disconnects mid-game, the quiz continues.  
- **Leaderboard & Scores:** Players earn points during the quiz, tracked in the server.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure
- `Client.java` â†’ Client-side code to connect and play.  
- `Server.java` â†’ Main server that manages queues and game sessions.  
- `PlayerInfoThread.java` â†’ Handles user authentication and session management.  
- `QueueThread.java` â†’ Manages the player queue logic.  
- `GameThread.java` â†’ Core game logic and communication between players.  
- `Player.java` â†’ Defines player objects with username, password, and score.  
- `Players.txt` â†’ Stores registered players and credentials.

## ðŸš€ How to Run
1. **Compile all Java files:**
   ```bash
   javac *.java
   ```
2. **Start the server:**
   ```bash
   java Server
   ```
3. **Start a client (repeat for multiple players):**
   ```bash
   java Client
   ```
4. Enter valid credentials from `Players.txt` to join the game.
